1. **Cyberattacks (ransomware, malware, data breaches).** Because budgets are tighter, independent cinemas are prime targets. Use a modern EDR, enforce MFA, and keep systems patched.
2. **Aging hardware and warranties.** Track lifecycles and extend warranties strategically to delay capex.
3. **Unmonitored backups.** Test restores monthly and keep at least one offline or immutable copy.
4. **Unmanaged Wiâ€‘Fi.** Segment guest from back-of-house networks; shorten DHCP leases during peak traffic.
5. **Single points of failure.** Identify critical devices (POS, ticketing, firewalls) and stock hot spares.

Each of these will get a dedicated deep-dive post with step-by-step actions tailored for independent theaters.
